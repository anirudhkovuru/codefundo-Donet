# Donet

## Problem Statement
Transparency in the management of funds in relief donations is absent. One cannot find out exactly where their donated money is being utilized.
Currently funds are prone to loss due to corruption and mismanagement. 
 
## Our Solution
Our solution aims to solve the problem of transparency by eliminating the middleman. We plan to provide an economic model using blockchain in which the donor directly provides funds for the victims of a natural disaster.
This motivates the donor to donate more money as they can visually see who they are donating to and what it is being used for.
This will provide an emotional connect between the donor and the victim and will also provide a greater sense of satisfaction to the donor.
This in turn can increase the number of people who are willing to donate.
